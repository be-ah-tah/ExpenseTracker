Running the program inside a **virtual environment** helps prevent conflicts with other Python packages installed on your system.

### **Steps to create a virtual environment**
1. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project/directory
   ```

2. **Create a new virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   - **Linux/Mac**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **Windows (PowerShell)**:
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

4. **Install the required libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Launch the application** by following the [Launch Instructions](#launch-instructions) above.

## ðŸ“Š **How to Use the Program**

1. **Input Your Expenses**
   - **Manual Input**: Users can enter expenses directly through a form in the app.
   - **Upload Statements**: Upload bank statements from the featured providers (Amex, Aqua and Lloyds). The system will automatically categorize and process the data.

2. **Filter Your Data**
   - **By Date**: Filter expenses by month, year, or a combination of both.
   - **By Category**: Exclude specific expense categories to customize your view (e.g., exclude "Housing" to see other expenses).

3. **View Insights and Visualizations**
   - **Pie Chart**: View the distribution of expenses by category.
   - **Bar Chart**: Compare current, previous, and average expenses for each category.

### **Example of Visualizations**
**Output Example**: See how your spending is distributed among categories and how it varies through different periods.

## âœ¨ **Additional Features**

1. **Automatic Statement Verification**
   - When users upload statements, the app checks the file format to ensure it matches the format required by the provider. This prevents errors and mismatched data.

2. **Comprehensive Filtering Options**
   - Filter by **month**, **year**, or **both** to get a more focused view of your expenses.

3. **Customizable Category Exclusion**
   - Users can exclude certain categories (like "housing") from visualizations to focus on specific expense types. This is useful if a large category (like rent) skews the visualizations.
